I would like to write a code that transliterate text with the following model:
each character is transformed into the next one:
$model

I would like you to create a diagram of necessary steps to write a code realising the above. Be verbose in the description. You can be creative with the approach.

Express the diagram in csv format with a unique column "id,description".

Return the csv data only, no additional text.
